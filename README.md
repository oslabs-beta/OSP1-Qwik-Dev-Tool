### A Chrome Development Extension for Qwik Developers

Qwik Dev Tool is a Chome extension designed to display and visualize innerworkings the [Qwik Web Framework](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/think-qwik/). This is done by capturing the lazy loaded network requests and interpreting the resumability model which is embedded within the HTML of all Qwik websites.

## Motiviations

Qwik is blazing fast thanks to removing the need for hydrations and instead utilizing a technique called [Resumability](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/concepts/resumable/) and utilizes a schema similar to that of React, Vue, or Svelte to design websites. For the developer, the complexity of the execution model is hidden away from the user which simplifies the development process; however, this abstraction hinders adoption of the platform as it is difficult to truly understand and appreciate the concepts occuring under the hood as well as the speed up in proformance compared to other other frameworks. In short, this tool is designed to help aspiring Qwik developers understand the complex interaction occuring when a lazy loaded component is loaded and to debug complex asynchronous interaction that can occur during app development.
